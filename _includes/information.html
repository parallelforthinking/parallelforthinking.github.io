        Parallel _ For Thinking is a platform committed to hosting and transmitting events in parallel to existing networks, industries and institutions to create a community for sourcing, promoting and distributing thinking and Culture associated within Architecture, Arts, Philosophy, Fashion, Literature and General Culture. We intend to create a space that is a catalyst for a new culture committed to establishing an international discourse through sharing ideas and discussion across the world; providing access to material and ideas previously limited to small groups of people, eliminating a minority like effect typically associated with thinking.

        Over the next six months, our residency in the Nicholas Building in Melbourneâ€™s CBD will generate, collate and archive content physically and digitally, through events including discussions, exhibitions, workshops and screenings, all of which will be live-streamed directly to the Parallel Website For Thinking.
