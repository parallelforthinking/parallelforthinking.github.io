 Parallel _ For Thinkingâ€™s pre-launch event is an evening for the exchange of thoughts and ideas. We will be announcing our program schedule for 2016 as well as our residency in the Nicholas Building. 

Parallel _ For Thinking is a platform coommitted to hosting events for promoting discussions concerning art, architecture, culture and thinking. Part exhibition, part panel discussion, all content and activities will be live-streamed, archived and shared online with an international audience. 

The night will coincide with the launch of our crowd-funding campaign which will provide us with the essential support to run future events.
