 DOWNTIME is considered a period of time when one is not working or active. Although often cast in negative light, DOWNTIME can generate positive consequences rarely discussed in relation to profit-centred culture and industry. 

We have been busy constructing the Parallel Space for Thinking in The Nicholas Building, placing us in our own period of DOWNTIME. This event will be non-physical and live-streamed from our construction site
